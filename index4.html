            <b>After you gather your supplies you know have to know how to actually care for the cat. Here are some of the main things to know for cat care:</b>
        </p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>
                <b>Nutrition:</b> Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that they require nutrients found only in animal products. Their diet should contain high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat, and a minimal amount of carbohydrates. In addition to protein, cats require more than a dozen other nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids. Although your cat needs certain amounts of each specific nutrient to be healthy, more is not always better.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Brushing:</b> Brushing your cat regularly helps remove dirt, grease, and dead hair from their coat. It also helps to remove skin flakes and stimulates blood circulation, improving the overall condition of their skin. One or two brushings per week will help keep your catâ€™s coat healthy and shiny.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Playing:</b> Playing with your cat is an important part of keeping them healthy and happy. It can help to build and strengthen your bond with your feline friend, as well as provide them with the mental and physical stimulation they need to thrive.  Not only does  play allow your cat to tap into their natural hunting instincts, but it also helps to deal with boredom and eliminate undesirable behaviours.
