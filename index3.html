                <b>Food:</b> If you acquire a cat from a breeder, more often than not, their contract will either strongly suggest or require you to feed a certain kind of food. Canned foods are better for cats, but your cat may be used to dry food only. Grown cats thrive on dry food, and any of the premium brands are acceptable. You should also supplement with canned food because eventually, you should try to move your cat over to canned only.

You should choose a litter that your cat likes.
